Student Enrollment Form that will store data in JsonPower database.
There will be three options available in the form to perform such as Save, Reset and Change. 
The save option saves the data entered in the database. Roll number being the primary key. 
The reset option clears all the fields in the form and takes the cursor to the roll number field. 
If the roll number already exists in the database, all the fields are filled by taking the data from the database. Enable [Update] and [Reset] buttons and move the cursor to the next' field in the form. Keep the primary key field disabled and allow users to change other form fields.
If the primary key value does NOT exist in the database, enable [Save] and [Reset] buttons and move the cursor to the next field and allow the user to enter data in the form.
It is checked that the data is valid i.e. no empty fields.
If the primary key value is present in the database, display that data in the form.
